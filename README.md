# Validate Survey Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is an extension of the Task 1 of the coding challenge. The goal of this project is to add form validation to the food survey using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository_name}.git
Once you have the code on your machine, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to view the survey.

# Usage
The survey is similar to the one in Task 1, but with the addition of form validation. The validation is implemented using JavaScript and checks for required fields, valid email addresses, and valid phone numbers.

If the user submits the form with invalid data, error messages are displayed next to the fields that need to be corrected. If all the data is valid, a success message is displayed and the form is submitted.

# Customization
If you want to customize the survey or the validation rules, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs. You can change the questions, add or remove fields, and adjust the validation rules to match your requirements.
